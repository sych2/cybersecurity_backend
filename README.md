🛡️ Cybersecurity Backend InfrastructureThis repository manages the cloud infrastructure for the Cybersecurity Backend using Terraform. It is designed with a Shift-Left security approach, utilizing pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and prevent secret leakage.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesTerraform (v1.0+)Python 3.x (for pre-commit hooks)AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.🛠️ Local Setup & DevSecOps GuardrailsTo prevent pushing large provider binaries (like the 800MB AWS provider) or sensitive secrets to GitHub, you must install the pre-commit hooks:Install the pre-commit framework:Bashpip install pre-commit
Install the git hooks:Bashpre-commit install
Now, every time you run git commit, your code will be checked for large files, secrets, and formatting.🏗️ Infrastructure CommandsCommandDescriptionterraform initInitializes the project and downloads providers (ignored by Git).terraform planGenerates an execution plan to preview changes.terraform applyDeploys the infrastructure to AWS.terraform fmtAutomatically formats the .tf files.🔒 Security PolicyWe use a multi-layered security approach:Local: pre-commit hooks block large files and unencrypted secrets.Static Analysis: tfsec or checkov scans for misconfigured cloud resources.Ignore Rules: The .gitignore file ensures .terraform/ and *.tfstate never leave your machine.
